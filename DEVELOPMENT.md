## Project Timeline

### Day 1: Project Setup & Basic Models (1 hour)
**Morning Session**
- Set up Rails 8.0 with GraphQL
- Created initial models (Menu, Section, Item, Product, Component)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Implemented Single Table Inheritance (STI) for model relationships
- Set up Factory Bot for test data generation

**Research:**
- Rails 8 GraphQL setup
- STI (Single Table Inheritance) Rails patterns
- Factory Bot with STI models

**Challenges:**
- Understanding polymorphic relationships between items
- Setting up proper model inheritance structure
- Configuring RSpec with Factory Bot

### Day 2: GraphQL Schema & Basic Queries (1 hour)
**Night Session**
- Implemented GraphQL types and basic queries
- Created resolvers for Menu and ModifierGroup

**Research:**
- GraphQL-Ruby resolver patterns
- GraphQL type definitions in Rails
- Testing GraphQL queries with RSpec

**Challenges:**
- Learning GraphQL-Ruby syntax
- Setting up proper type definitions
- Understanding resolver patterns

### Day 3: Testing & Documentation & Deployment (1 hour)
**Morning Session**
- Revised seed data
- Wrote basic tests for Menu type
- Added README documentation

**Research:**
- Docker configuration for Rails 8
- GraphQL query documentation best practices
- Factory Bot associations setup

**Night Session**
- Successfully deployed to Heroku

**Challenges:**
- Creating meaningful test data
- Writing clear API documentation
- Basic Docker configuration

**Total Development Time:** 4 hours (4 days, 1 hour per day)

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimization
**Current Issues:**
- N+1 queries in nested resolvers
- Missing database indexes
- No query batching implementation

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Implement GraphQL::Batch for query optimization
- Add necessary database indexes
- Use connection types for pagination

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
**Current Issues:**
- Limited test coverage for complex queries
- Missing mutation tests
- No integration tests for full query flow

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Add comprehensive mutation tests
- Implement integration tests for common query patterns
- Set up CI pipeline with test coverage reporting

### 3. Error Handling
**Current Issues:**
- Basic error handling only
- No custom error types
- Missing validation error responses

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Implement custom error types
- Add detailed validation error messages
- Set up proper error tracking

### 4. Infrastructure & DevOps
**Current Issues:**
- Basic Docker setup only
- No CI/CD pipeline
- Missing proper logging configuration

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Enhance Docker configuration for development/production
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Implement structured logging with proper levels
